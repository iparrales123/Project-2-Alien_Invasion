# Project_2_Alien_Invasion
OVERVIEW This is a simplified version of the popular Space Invaders game. The game has the following features:

- A ship that moves and shoots lasers.
- A fleet of aliens that is trying to collide with the ship and destroy it.
- Multiple copies of ships so the player can have more than one chance to win.
- Multiple levels, with the speed (and point value) of the aliens increasing with each new level.
- A scoreboard to track of your score, and your high score.
- A menu button that allows the game to start, or to play again if you lose, or just like winning again
